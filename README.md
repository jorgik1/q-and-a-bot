#Q&A Bot
This application is designed to help users find answers from the content in their files. By leveraging the power of OpenAI embeddings and GPT, our Q&A bot can search through uploaded documents and provide relevant answers.

##How it Works
Upload Your Files: To start, upload the files you want the bot to search through. These could be text files, PDFs, Word documents, and more.

Ask Your Question: Once your files are uploaded, simply ask your question. The bot will analyze your question and search through the uploaded documents for relevant answers.

Get Your Answer: The bot will provide the most relevant answer it can find from the documents. It uses advanced AI algorithms to ensure the answers are as accurate and helpful as possible.
